# [T1176 - Browser Extensions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1176/)
Adversaries may abuse Internet browser extensions to establish persistent access to victim systems. Browser extensions or plugins
are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of Internet browsers. They can be installed directly or through
a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access.

Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, 
through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system. Security can be limited on browser app stores 
so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners. Depending on the browser, adversaries may also 
manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from an adversary controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration 
file to silently install additional extensions.

Previous to macOS 11, adversaries could silently install browser extensions via the command line using the `profiles` tool to install 
malicious `.mobileconfig` files. In macOS 11+, the use of the `profiles` tool can no longer install configuration profiles, however 
`.mobileconfig` files can be planted and installed with user interaction.

Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user enters into a browser 
(including credentials), and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence.

There have also been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions. There have also been similar 
examples of extensions being used for command & control.

## Procedure Examples
|ID|Name|Description|
|--|----|-----------|
|S0482|Bundlore|Bundlore can install malicious browser extensions that are used to hijack user searches.|
|S0531|Grandoreiro|Grandoreiro can use malicious browser extensions to steal cookies and other user information.|
|G0094|Kimsuky|Kimsuky has used Google Chrome browser extensions to infect victims and to steal passwords and cookies.|
|S0402|OSX/Shlayer|OSX/Shlayer can install malicious Safari browser extensions to serve ads.|
## Mitigations
|ID|Mitigtaion|Description|
|--|----------|-----------|
|M1047|Audit|Ensure extensions that are installed are the intended ones as many malicious extensions will masquerade as legitimate ones.|
|M1038|Execution Prevention|Set a browser extension allow or deny list as appropriate for your security policy.|
|M1033|Limit Software Installation|Only install browser extensions from trusted sources that can be verified. Browser extensions for some browsers can be controlled through Group Policy. Change settings to prevent the browser from installing extensions without sufficient permissions.|
|M1051|Update Software|Ensure operating systems and browsers are using the most current version.|
|M1017|User Training|Close out all browser sessions when finished using them to prevent any potentially malicious extensions from continuing to run.|
## Detecions
|ID|Data Source|Data Component|Detects|
|--|-----------|--------------|-------|
|DS0017|Command|Command Execution|Monitor executed commands and arguments for usage of the profiles tool, such as profiles install -type=configuration.|
|DS0022|File|File Creation|Monitor for newly constructed files and/or all installed extensions maintain a plist file in the /Library/Managed Preferences/username/ directory. Ensure all listed files are in alignment with approved extensions|
|DS0029|Network Traffic|Network Connection Creation|Monitor for newly constructed network connections that are sent or received by untrusted hosts.|
|DS0009|Process|Process Creation|Monitor for newly executed processes that could be used to abuse internet browser extensions to establish persistence.|
|DS0024|Windows Registry|Windows Registry Key Creation|Monitor for any new items written to the Registry or PE files written to disk. That may correlate with browser extension installation.|
